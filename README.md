#### Class project to create a porfolio website using only HTML and CSS with the help from Copilot.

## The truth is I ran through all my Copilot tokens attempting to make the AI tool fix errors it was creating.
## Maybe my prompts were too complicated or I didn't word my statements correctly.

## I ended up finishing the project without AI but did use ChatGPT for help with some style questions or asking if a CSS :not selector was correct.
